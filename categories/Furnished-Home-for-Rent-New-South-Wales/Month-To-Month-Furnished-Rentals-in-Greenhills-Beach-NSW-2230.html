Think about what annoys you most when you are on your holiday, and this will give you a clue as to what to expect from your guests. Most complaints from guests will be about the cleanliness of your Weekly Furnished Rentals in Greenhills Beach NSW 2230. Different people have different expectations, and you can't please all the people all of the time. If you or your agent on the ground receives more than one complaint about the cleanliness of your property then it makes sense to re-arrange your cleaning contract.

</p>
<p>
You have received an enquiry for your holiday home and spoken to the potential guest and agreed on a price; now you need to take payment. It is worth bearing in mind, at this juncture, that this always has the potential to be a nervous time for the renter, whether they are booking directly with the owner or going through an agency. To this end, it will pay you dividends to be organised at your end so that you can put any nerves at ease.
</p>
<p>
Managing guest expectations is a must. List the ground rules in your booking contract to help avoid potential disagreements with your guests. Keep your adverts up to date, giving all the correct information and providing contact details where guests can contact you or your agent. Make sure your Weekly Furnished Rentals in Sutherland Shire are accurate and up to date too. Keep up to date with maintenance and inform renters of any essential works that may be carried out during their stay - this will again help avoid any misunderstandings.

Guest expectations not met on arrival at the property can get you off on the wrong footing. Remember what it's like to finally arrive on your holiday only to be let down by the accommodation. Make sure that you have clear instructions and good systems in place for things like key handovers, directions, hot water, etc. Your guests may be exhausted on arrival and will want everything to go as smoothly as possible when they finally get there.
</p>
<p>
Prepare a little local knowledge for when clients arrive. If you can get maps from the local tourist office, or leave recommendations as to your favourite bars, restaurants, cafes, etc. This is always well received. If you know the best day to visit the main attractions, as it's quieter and less crowded - mention this. Are there any hidden gems that you love about your location that maybe the typical guide books don't pick up on?
</p>
<p>
Let's be honest, sometimes pets can be a handful, and sometimes it's relaxing to have a little time away. Further, think of it from your pet's vantage point. Traveling is stressful for animals. Comfortable, in-cabin airplane travel is usually limited to smaller pets, and even then it can be a terrifying event in a pet's life.

Pet travel as checked baggage means you'll be separated from your pet until you get to your destination, at which point you can go to your vacation rental together. Strict size requirements for kennels goes into effect for this type of the trip, the minimum size usually being so your pet can turn around quickly without touching the sides of the enclosure. Airlines have temperature controlled holding facilities at their hubs so that pets will be taken care in a comfortable environment in the event of a flight delay. Fees for this method of pet travel can be as much, or more, than carry on. 
</p>
<p>
We all know that children are curious, playful and full of energy especially when going to a different place or destination. Parents will have a hard time taking care of their children. Thus, the best thing to do is child proof you holiday house. For example, you have delicate items in the room, and then make sure it is in the right place, organizing things can be somewhat hard is you have less time but in the end it will save time, money and effort.
</p>
<p>
Airlines offer three options for pet travel: checking your pet as baggage, pet shipping, and co-location in the cabin. Booth fees range from $50 to $200, and while probably the most comfortable for your pet, some with some pretty hefty restrictions. Pets generally must fit comfortably in a kennel that will slide under the seat in front of you. For pets to travel in the main cabin, they must remain in their kennels for the duration of the flight, and there can be no more than one or two (depending on which airline you fly) in each cabin.
</p>
<p>
No matter how hard you try or how conscientious you are, you will inevitably receive a complaint from time to time. It will happen, so it is best to be prepared for it so that you do not have to worry unduly. Handling customer complaints can be the toughest thing to swallow, especially if your holiday home is the jewel in your eye. It is easy to take it personally but remember renting a vacation home is a business and so you must treat it like one. Try to keep in mind that often a complaint is a learning opportunity and it can pay dividends to take action. To that end listen to what the guest has to say, let them get it out of their system. Empathize with them and get an action plan together to deal with the issue at hand. Prompt action often turns a complainant from a foe to friend and they may then recommend you to their friends in turn.
</p>
<p>
There are several accepted methods of payment. Obviously, credit card debt is often thought of as a safe, convenient way - not least as it affords the renter some protection against fraud, etc. If you cannot take credit card payments yourself, think about setting up a PayPal account or such like. This is a convenient way for you to make use of credit cards booking, allowing you the flexibility of credit card payment for a small fee. Your renters will not necessarily need their PayPal account to make a payment into your account, and it affords peace of mind, as there is some protection for them in using this method.

<p>
A more traditional method of payment is by using a cheque. Most people are familiar with this process, and if the renter has a checking account in the same country as you, there should be no additional charges. Obviously, this method is slightly slower, and there can be a bit of an issue to negotiate with foreign currency cheques etc. Make sure that you have some booking reference system so that the renter can write a reference number on the back of any cheque - not being quite sure who a check has come from can add stress to the situation.
</p>
<p>
Do not try to duck the issue. There is nothing worse for a guest than to be unable to contact somebody if they do have an issue. Make sure Weekly Furnished Rentals in Greenhills Beach NSW are up to date and respond as quickly as possible. This will save both time and stress for both parties and will enable you to be pro-active in the management of your property. Ask guests for feedback regarding what they think may need improvement or could be done better - this is positive and leaves a good impression.
</p>
<p>
That being said, there are more pet-friendly vacation options than ever before, especially if you're not leaving the country. While most hotels and resort-style hotels don't allow pets, you'll find a huge number of vacation rentals by owner that are not only pet-friendly but run by pet owners who make every effort to ensure you and your pet's stay is pleasant. 
</p>
<p>
Be clear about what you expect regarding taking payments and their timing. Send the renter an e-mail laying out the terms clearly and directly. Show them the totals and the breakdown and when each payment is expected. Try to offer more than one method of payment so they have options. Instant money transfers are no longer deemed an acceptable form of payment by many, due to misuse by some individuals - try to offer an alternative. 
</p>
<p>
Don't panic - it is not as awful as it all seems. With one trip under your belt you'll be an old master at traveling with your four-legged best friend. Most <strong>Weekly Furnished Rentals in Greenhills Beach New South Wales 2230</strong> have options to search with a pet friendly filter on, and I think you'll be taken aback at the number of choices. If going somewhere near and warm the water with your dog, look for a leash-free beach where you can both play and run. Search for snowshoe or cross country ski vacation rentals so you can get some good and hiking exercise in if going somewhere cold. Wherever you end up going, make sure you contact the vacation rental owner before you leave to ensure everything will be prepared for your pet, your family, and you when you arrive.
